# ASP.NET 8 Configurations

**What comes to your mind when you think about the word Host?**

A Host takes care of you.
Remember, the last time you visited your Auntâ€™s home, the food, the movies, and everything they made possible for you.

But we are talking about the .NET, a cross-platform framework.
What possible relevance does it have with Auntâ€™s home visit?

Well, the .NET Host takes care of your application by providing out-of-the-box features such as:

- Configuration
- Logging
- Dependency Injection

and many more. 

<!--truncate-->


~~~csharp title="Web Application Host in ASP.NET 8"
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);  
    
    var app = builder.Build();

    app.Run();
~~~

The `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);` configures the host for your web application with _reasonable defaults_.
But does this mean you cannot customize the host configurations?


> You can! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ But how? ðŸ¤” Before you learn about the usage, would it be a bad idea to learn about reasonable defaults?

## Reasonable Application Configuration Defaults

If I tell you the list of defaults, it will be hard to remember, so let's reason about it.

Imagine, you are tasked to build a Host which supports:

> Story: As a developer, I would like to adjust my application behavior based on the configuration.

You begin asking yourself, what are the most common ways developers configure their application? 
The answer you came up with:

- CLI Arguments such as `dotnet run` accepts arguments.
- Environment Variables such as setting the path of Node.js
- Configuration Files such as XML, JSON, INI etc

You decided to pair with a team member Jon about the story who also has a keen interest in security.

He confirms that the above three most common ways.
But point out that there have been many instances of security breaches
simply because someone accidentally committed the application secrets to git repository. 

You suggested implementing a way to keep the secrets outside the git repository but still able
to read these configurations in your application.
Jon said great, but how will it work in the CI pipeline which does not have access to your local files.
After a few moments,
you both decided that it will be good trade off that if it only works when the application environment is Development.

That's how `dotnet user-secrets` is born.
It stops accidental leakage of your secrets.
Be warned, it is still plain JSON strings and is not encrypted.

**Oh Encrypted secrets,**
that is an excellent idea that brings you to the custom configuration services such as Azure Vault Storage,
HashiCorp Vault, etc. 

Before, you learn about how to integrate or implement custom configuration services.
You said wait, what about if the same key is present in both environment variables and JSON settings file.
And Jon said, well easy the configuration which is read in the last wins.
But you said, what will be the order of these configuration sources i.e., environment variables, JSON settings file.
After a brief pause, you said that it will be best if we keep the order consistent with developer flow.

You concluded that a developer flow looks like this:

1. Create configuration settings in `appsettings.json`. 
2. Different environments like Staging, Production might have different settings thus `appsettings.{EnvName}.json`
3. Oh, few of those are secrets thus `user-secrets.json` in `Development` environment.
4. Environment Variables for some.
5. Lastly, CLI Arguments because that's when you actually run the application.

The last configuration source wins. And this is the default behavior of `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`.

But You use `Vault` in production. _You will have to manually configure it._ How? We will explore it in another post.

You were implementing the story below,
but I do not see any architecture neither any direction on how to implement a custom configuration source. 

> Story: As a developer, I would like to adjust my application behavior based on the configuration.

Since we are reading the configuration from multiple sources.
Having an interface which reads the configuration from a single source would make sense. 

Bingo! ðŸ”¥

The .NET team provides you the `IConfigurationSource` interface
which has a single method `IConfigurationProvider Build(IConfigurationBuilder builder);`
and `ConfigurationManager` exposes the `Sources` property which is a mutable list of `IConfigurationSource`.

Once you implemented `IConfigurationSource` on your custom configuration source class say TextFileConfigurationSource.
You can add it to the configuration sources list using `ConfigurationManager.Sources.Add(new TextFileConfigurationSource());`
and you will be able to read the configuration from the text file.

The `IConfigurationSource` `Build` method returns `IConfigurationProvider`
that have methods to load the configuration from the source and reload it and others.
But you can take advantage of `ConfigurationProvider` abstract class,
and you will only have to implement `Load` method.
In the `Load` method you can parse the text file
and add the key-value pairs to the `Data` property of the `ConfigurationProvider` class.

:::tip

If you feel annoyed by the default configurations and their orders.
You should try `WebApplication.CreateEmptyBuilder(new WebApplicationOptions());`.
Well, I am tiny bit annoyed then try `WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args)`.

## Reasonable Host Configuration Defaults

Every house has an address, right? Yes, the owner has a name. 

Similarly, the ASP.NET Host allows you to configure its name, address, and a few other settings.
It allows you to do it in multiple ways.
The code snippet below shows how you can change a few of those.

```csharp title="Use WebApplicationOptions overload to customize"

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(new WebApplicationOptions()
{
    Args = args, // This is the same args which you pass to the CreateBuilder method. It will respect the command line arguments.
    ApplicationName = "MottoBits.Api", // It defaults to the assembly name.
    ContentRootPath = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), // default:This paths is used to read your appsettings.json
    WebRootPath = "wwwroot" // This path is used to serve static files, not relevant for APIs
});

```

Do you know that you can bring the web application host to life by running dotnet run command?

Yes, I knew that. And also you can pass CLI arguments to change the behavior of the Host.

`dotnet run --project ./MottoBits.Api.csproj --environment Production --urls "http://localhost:8080;https://localhost:4434"`

The `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);` method takes an optional parameter of type
`string[]` which is named `args` and the values are passed from the command line using `--` prefix.

> Success ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ But do not forget to check logs. ðŸ¤”

You must be wondering if the Host configurations can be changed using environment variables.
The answer is YES.
In fact, you can change the Host behavior by passing environment variables with two different prefixes which are:
- DOTNET_ 
- ASPNETCORE_

Why two different prefixes.
The DOTNET_ prefixed environment variables may change the behavior other than the Host such as runtime. 

What happens if multiple configuration sources have the same key.
**The rule is the last one wins.**
For the Host configurations, below is the order:

1. ASPNETCORE_ prefixed environment variables.
2. DOTNET_ prefixed environment variables.
3. CLI Arguments. The last one wins because it provides you the last chance you can change configurations.
