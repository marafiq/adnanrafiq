# A Complete Guide to all ASP.NET Builtin Middlewares

Middleware is a function in then ASP.NET 8,
when many functions are invoked one after the other like a chain; 
it becomes a middleware pipeline.
The middleware pipeline is responsible for handling the incoming HTTP request and outgoing HTTP response.

For in depth understanding of the middleware
you can read my blog post [here](https://adnanrafiq.com/blog/develop-intuitive-understanding-of-middleware-in-asp-net8/).

This is a series of blog posts in which I will cover all the builtin middlewares in ASP.NET 8. 

<!--truncate-->

## How many Middlewares are in ASP.NET 8?

There are 16 builtin middlewares in ASP.NET 8 to build a REST API. This post will cover two of them.

- [HostingFiltering](#host-filtering-middleware)
- [HeaderPropagation](#header-propagation-middleware)

## Host Filtering Middleware

### Purpose
Allow requests only from the allowed hosts using the host header of HTTP Request.

### Defaults
- AllowedHosts: *
- IncludeFailureDetails: true
- AllowEmptyHosts: true â€” HTTP 1.0 requests don't have a host header.

### Customization
- AllowedHosts can be a comma-separated list of host names or IP addresses.
- AllowedHosts can be a wildcard pattern like *.google.com.

### How to use it?

Default Minimal API template adds the following JSON property in the `appsettings.json` file.

```csharp Title="appsettings.json"
{
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

```csharp Title="Using HostFiltering Middleware"
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();
//It Uses appsettings.json file to read the allowed host names. By default is is * which means all hosts are allowed.
app.UseHostFiltering(); 
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.Run();
```
You can customize the JSON property in the `appsettings.json` file.
```csharp Title="appsettings.json"
{
  "AllowedHosts": "localhost,localhost:5000,localhost:5001,*.example.com,139.343.3434.3434"
}
```
```csharp Title="Add Options to HostFiltering Middleware"
services.AddOptions<HostFilteringOptions>()
.BindConfiguration(builder.Configuration.GetRequiredSection("HostFilteringOptions").Path);
/////////////// OR ////////////////
services.AddHostFiltering(options =>
{
    options.AllowedHosts = new List<string>() { "*" };
    options.AllowEmptyHosts = true;
    options.IncludeFailureMessage = true;
});

```
### Best Practices
- Should be added after the ExceptionHandler middleware.
- It should not be used as a replacement of security features. Attacker can easily manipulate the host header.
  - Example: If you ask your security to let only in person with the name of adnan. Anyone pretending to be adnan will be allowed.
- Read the source code in .NET repository [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Middleware/HostFiltering/src/HostFilteringMiddleware.cs).

## Header Propagation Middleware
### Purpose
It propagates the headers from the incoming request to the outgoing request. 
For example,
a Service receives a header named X-Custom-Header, and it calls Service B, 
and you would like to send the header whenever this call is made.
That is Propagation of Headers.
:::info
Must install the package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HeaderPropagation` from NuGet.
:::

In Legacy applications if you have not adapted the [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/net/getting-started/)
and you rely on correlation id to trace the request across multiple services.
For example,
your request flows through a reverse proxy which adds certain e-commerce, unique request id and other headers
on which your system relies on.
You could use the Header Propagation middleware to propagate the headers to the outgoing request.
Simple correlation header flow will give you an end to end logs of the request.
Currently, I am using this technique in production
to trace the request across multiple services which uses different technologies like Node.js,
Java, .NET 6, .NET Framework 4.8.

### Defaults
- Allows to configure the headers to be propagated to the outgoing HTTP requests using `HttpClient`.
- Allows configuring the headers to be propagated with value provider function which does have access to `HTTPContext`.
- Allows changing the header name from incoming request to outgoing request.

### Customization
- You have to explicitly configure the headers to be propagated. No default.
### How to use it?
```csharp Title="Configure Header Propagation"
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddHeaderPropagation(options =>
{
    //Add the header to be propagated.
    options.Headers.Add("X-Custom-Header");
    
    //Add the header to be propagated with value provider function.
    options.Headers.Add("CorelationId", context =>
    {
        var request = context.Request;
        var header = request.Headers["CorelationId"].FirstOrDefault();
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(header))
        {
            header = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        }
        return header;
    });
    options.Headers.Add("CorelationId", "X-CorelationId");
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.UseHeaderPropagation();
app.MapGet("/motto", async (HttpContext context, HttpClient client) =>
{
    //Now the outgoing request will have the header X-CorelationId and X-Custom-Header.
    // No need to add the header manually.
    var response = await client.GetAsync("http://localhost:5000/greeting");
    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    await context.Response.WriteAsync(content);
});
app.MapGet("/greeting", async (HttpContext context) =>
{
    //Read the header from the incoming request.
    var header = context.Request.Headers["X-CorelationId"].FirstOrDefault();
    await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Hello from Greeting Service. You are using {header}");
});
app.Run();
```
### Best Practices
- Should be added after the ExceptionHandler middleware.
- Every server receiving the request has a limit on the number of headers it can receive. It also has limit on the size of the header. Kestrel has a limit of 100 headers and 32KB size. You should take this into consideration when propagating headers.
- Keep the number of headers and size to the minimum. Minimum means only add if it is required. Do not violate [You ain't going to need it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) principle (YAGNI).
- Read the source code in .NET repository [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Middleware/HeaderPropagation/src/HeaderPropagationMiddleware.cs)
